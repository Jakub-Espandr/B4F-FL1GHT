# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.4] - 2025-06-09

### Added
- Multi-log color support: Each log uses a distinct color palette 
- Legends now show each feature for each log, with log names and correct colors.
- Step Response PID legend displays Feed Forward (FF) and D_min values parsed from the BBL header

### Fixed
- Legend formatting

### Changed
- PID, Feed Forward, and D_min values are now always shown in the Step Response legend for each axis, with improved formatting
- Improved debug output and ensured color assignments are consistent for plots and legends

  - Support for selecting up to 5 flights in Step Response tab for comparison
  - Support for selecting up to 2 flights in Spectral Analysis tab
- Added automatic deselection of logs when switching between tabs
- Added improved handling of spectral analysis checkbox selection
- Added proper separation of spectral and step response log selection handlers

### Improved
- Enhanced signal handling for checkbox and log selection events

## [0.4.2] - 2025-06-08

### Added
- Multi-log loading and selection:
  - Load and display multiple logs in a list

### Improved
- UI/UX:
  - More compact log selector (combo box for single selection)
  - Space-efficient and modern layout
- Plot clearing:
  - All plots and annotation labels are cleared before plotting new data to prevent caching/overlays
- Annotation management:
  - Robust handling to prevent crashes and segmentation faults

### Fixed
- Prevented double-attaching axes ("Axis already attached to series" warning)
- Safely deleted annotation proxies and handled signal disconnects
- Removed debug print statements
- Various segmentation faults and warnings addressed
